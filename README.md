# Design-and-Verification-of-a-Register-Controlled-Counter-Module
Implemented a register module for an 8-bit counter with a 1 KB address space, 32-bit access, immediate read, delayed write, and invalid address handling. Features include overflow detection, asynchronous reset, and conditional counting using D flip-flops, optimized for embedded systems.
